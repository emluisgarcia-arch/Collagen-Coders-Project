# Collagen-Coders-Project
Repo for BINF 2111 semester project. 
Collagen Coders Project by Emilio Garcia and Dexter Watson

Our project eill take information about the COL2A1 gene and determine if there are any potentioal issues in the gene
The program will output where the issue in the gene lies and what genetic problem that can happen.
The COL2A1 gene provides instructinos too create a basic component used in type II collagen. This collagen is used in conective tissues in the joints and organs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential Diseases that can arise are :
Sitckler Syndrome - Weakens the collagen in the body. Can casue facial deformation, retianl detactchment, nearsightedness, and glaucoma
Early onset familial osteoarthritis
Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED)
Achondrogenesis type 2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will use FASTA files of the above mentiond diseases and compare them with the FASTA file of a COL2A1 gene that has no issues with it.
We will use Python and Bio python in this program to achiveve the desired results.
